Given a service running on a set of servers,
each with an initial % success factor,
design a load-balancer. Design the same load-balancer for the case when the success factor can change dynamically over a period of time.
You have to write the code for both the parts and make a functional demo. The demo can have any interface (CLI/webapp).

GFG greedy problem was asked in interview (easy)

Given two sorted arrays of size m and n+m. Merge them in to 1 single sorted array with out extra space and in o(n) time.

You have a huge stream of numbers coming in say n numbers which are distinct but not in order.
There are two numbers missing from it. Find those missing two numbers.

You are supposed to input stream of n number,
but 2 numbers were lost during transmission.
The numbers ranged from 1 to n.
You donot have n given to you, but you need to figure out yourself,
what you know for sure is that exactly two numbers are missing. Find the missing numbers.

Search for a zero-sum subarray in a given array.

finding the second largest number from an array

What's the runtime complexity of this recursive algorithm...

Find if there exist a triplet in array such that a[i]<a[j]<a[k] and i<j<k

In a given array, you have to find the maximum sum possible with the below conditions
a) You can pick the single element
b) You can pick elements, than in that case you have to multiply them and add to sum
c) Each element can be used once only.

Given 2 arrays of integers [1,2,3,3,5] [3,5] find the intersection between both arrays and return those integers. In this case output will be [1,2]

Implement a stack which will have 2 methods getMax() and max(), where getMax() will return max value from the stack,
where as max() will return maximum value from the stack as well as pop the maximum value from stack.
